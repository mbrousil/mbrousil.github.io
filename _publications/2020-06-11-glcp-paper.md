This is a paper describing a dataset we compiled of lake surface area for > 1.42  million lakes and reservoirs >= 10 hectares in area, matched with basin-level temperature, precipitation, and population data. Data are a time series covering 1995 to 2015 (although resolution differs by variable). The dataset is intended to be fully reproducible: all scripts and a standardized file structure are available with the full dataset at [EDI](https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/834e2d4e8ee7eb2fa9a5a5b32d759683).
